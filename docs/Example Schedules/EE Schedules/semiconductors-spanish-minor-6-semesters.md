# Semiconductors, Spanish Minor, 6 Semesters

I am in my final semester as an EE major in Spring 2024, and plan on continuing to get my MS in the fall. I have been heavily involved in research, which takes up most of my time outside of classes. I have a Spanish minor because I came in with lots of credit via AP classes, so it was very easy to get. You probably will not be able to replicate this schedule because of the credits I came in with, so I would use my schedule to try to gauge what courseload works well with research.

## Features of this Schedule

- Tack on an extra semester if you did not come in with all the math courses completed
- Lots of research credit, so there is room for another class or two if you do not do research
- Spanish Minor + Chancellor's Scholar

## Schedule

### AP Credits and Proficiency Tests
| Course Name | Credit Hours |
| --- | --- |
| [MATH220 - Calculus](../../Course%20Wiki/MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH220.md) | 5 |
| [MATH231 - Calculus II](../../Course%20Wiki/MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH231.md) | 3 |
| [MATH241 - Calculus III](../../Course%20Wiki/MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH241.md) | 4 |
| MATH286 - Intro to Diff Eq Plus | 4 |
| MATH415 - Applied Linear Algebra | 3 |
| [PHYS211 - University Physics: Mechanics](../../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS211.md) | 4 |
| [PHYS212 - University Physics: Electricity & Magnetism](../../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS212.md) | 4 |
| [CS101 - Intro Computing: Engrg & Sci](../../Course%20Wiki/CS%20Course%20Offerings/CS101.md) | 3 |
| GEOG104 - Social and Cultural Geography | 4 |
| ECON103 - Macroeconomic Principles | 3 |
| PS101 - Intro to US Gov & Pol | 3 |
| RHET105 - Writing and Research | 4 |
| SPAN200 - Readings in Hispanic Texts | 3 |
| SPAN204 - Advanced Spanish Grammer in Context | 3 |
| HIST141 - Western Civilization to 1660 | 3 |
| MUS133 - Intro to World Music | 3 |
| **Total** | **56** |

One of the defining features of my schedule is I did not have to take any math courses in college, I was able to get college credit for courses I took in high school. MATH286 and MATH415 do not technically satisfy the requirements for [MATH285](../../Course%20Wiki/MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH285.md) and [MATH257](../../Course%20Wiki/MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH257.md), but I was able to get an override. I also did not technically need to take as many gen eds as I did because I came in with so much credit (from AP classes and a few community college courses), but I had to take some as part of the Campus Honors Program to maintain my early registration benefit.

### 1st Semester, Freshman Year, Fall 2021
| Course Name | Credit Hours |
| --- | --- |
| [ECE110 - Introduction to Electronics](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE110.md) | 3 |
| [ENG100 - Engineering Orientation](../../Course%20Wiki/Other%20Course%20Offerings/ENG100.md) | 0 |
| [CHEM102 - General Chemistry I](../../Course%20Wiki/Other%20Course%20Offerings/CHEM102.md) | 3 |
| [CHEM103 - General Chemistry Lab I](../../Course%20Wiki/Other%20Course%20Offerings/CHEM103.md) | 1 |
| ASTR210 - Introduction to Astrophysics | 3 |
| ARCH199 - Undergraduate Open Seminar | 3 |
| CHP199 - Honors Uncommon Reads | 1 |
| SPAN228 - Spanish Composition | 3 |
| **Total** | **17** |

There is nothing too interesting about my first semester in terms of courses. Coming in with a lot of credit meant there were not any open seats in classes I would have ideally liked to take. I used that extra time to adjust to college life, and get started in research. I actually joined a few RSOs and even the 110/120 honors lab before joining my research group, which I ended up liking a lot more.

#### Tips:
- Party hard, you're free!
- Try new things

### 2nd Semester, Freshman Year, Spring 2022
| Course Name | Credit Hours |
| --- | --- |
| [ECE120 - Introduction to Computing](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE120.md) | 4 |
| [ECE210 - Analog Signal Processing](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE210.md) | 4 |
| [PHYS213 - University Physics: Thermal Physics](../../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS213.md) | 2 |
| [PHYS214 - University Physics: Quantum Physics](../../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS214.md) | 2 |
| ASTR350 - Big Bang, Black Holes, and the End of the Universe | 3 |
| SPAN308 - Spanish in the United States | 3 |
| **Total** | **18** |

I definitely recommend the 2nd semester combo of [ECE120](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE120.md) and [ECE210](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE210.md) for EE majors if you have the prerequisites. You open up a lot more classes for your sophomore year the quicker you get through [ECE210](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE210.md).

#### Tips:
- [ECE210](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE210.md) knocks a lots of people down, do not let it scare you.

### Summer 2022
| Course Name | Credit Hours |
| --- | --- |
| [ECE220 - Computer Systems & Programming](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE220.md) | 4 |
| **Total** | **4** |

I did not have an internship over my first summer, so I took [ECE220](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE220.md). It is significantly less work over the summer, but as an EE I do not think I lost anything because of it.

### 3rd Semester, Sophomore Year, Fall 2022
| Course Name | Credit Hours |
| --- | --- |
| [ECE310 - Digital Signal Processing](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE310.md) | 3 |
| [ECE311 - Digital Signal Processing Lab](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE311.md) | 1 |
| [ECE329 - Fields and Waves I](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE329.md) | 3 |
| [ECE340 - Semiconductor Electronics](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE340.md) | 3 |
| ECE396 - Honors Project | 2 |
| ECE200 - Seminar | 0 |
| ENG199 - Undergraduate Research Seminar | 1 |
| LER199 - Immigration & Race: The Evolution of Legal Equality | 3 |
| SPAN252 - Intro to Hispanic Linguistics
| **Total** | **19** |

Anyone that wants to go into the semiconductor field should try to take [ECE329](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE329.md) and [ECE340](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE340.md) ASAP. They open the door to almost every semiconductor/EM class offered. 

I took ECE200 due to the requirement for James Scholars, but realized I got overlapping benefits from the Campus Honors program, so I stopped taking it the next year.

I probably worked about 10-15 hours per week on research activites, so factor that into the time commitment for the courses.

The only reason I had to overload was because I was required to take ENG199 for my research, but it was a weekly seminar course so the workload was non-existent.

#### Tips:
- Take [ECE311](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE311.md) while you take [ECE310](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE310.md). If you have any Python experience it will be a breeze.

### 4th Semester, Sophomore Year, Spring 2023
| Course Name | Credit Hours |
| --- | --- |
| [ECE313 - Probability with Engineering Applications](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE313.md) | 3 |
| [ECE314 - Probability in Engineering Lab](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE314.md) | 1 |
| [ECE350 - Fields and Waves II](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE350.md) | 3 |
| [ECE441 - Physics & Modeling of Semiconductor Devices](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE441.md) | 3 |
| ECE396 - Honors Project | 2 |
| CLCV133 - Archaeology of Israel | 3 |
| SPAN307 - Bilingualism | 3 |
| **Total** | **18** |

In retrospect, this was probably my easiest semester. [ECE313](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE313.md) if fairly infamous because of how different the content is from any of the other ECE classes, but I found it not as difficult as I expected. 

I highly recommend [ECE441](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE441.md) for anyone that wants to go into semiconductors. Think of it as [ECE340](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE340.md) part II.

#### Tips:
- Take [ECE314](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE314.md), (again) if you have any Python experience it is quite easy.

### 5th Semester, Junior/Senior Year, Fall 2023
| Course Name | Credit Hours |
| --- | --- |
| [ECE342 - Electronic Circuits](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE342.md) | 3 |
| [ECE343 - Electronic Circuits Lab](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE343.md) | 1 |
| [ECE385 - Digital Systems Lab](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE385.md) | 3 |
| [ECE444 - IC Device Theory & Fabrication](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE444.md) | 4 |
| [ECE496 - Senior Research Project](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE496.md) | 2 |
| CHP395 - Transitional Justice | 3 |
| **Total** | **16** |

I found [ECE385](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE385.md) to be not relevant for what I want to do. It is a difficult class that takes a lot of time, but it is not hard to get a good grade in. I recommend EE majors stick to a very simple final project, your time is better spent elsewhere. Advisors are also pushing people to take this class closer to [ECE120](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE120.md). For the EE majors who do not benefit from this class, I would say to take this class whenever you want. Knowledge from [ECE120](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE120.md) only makes a big difference for the first real lab (technically Lab 2).

I am torn about whether to recommend [ECE444](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE444.md). Some of the lectures were useful, the lab was not relevant for modern day semiconductors (because all the equipment and techniques are decades old), but I know some companies like to see cleanroom experience. If you can get cleanroom experience through some other means (internship, research) I would try to get the lectures slides from someone else and skip taking the class.


#### Tips:
- Start labs for [ECE385](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE385.md) very early.
- Take [ECE343](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE343.md), it is minimal work and satisfies the hardware lab requirement.

### 6th Semester, Junior/Senior Year, Spring 2024
