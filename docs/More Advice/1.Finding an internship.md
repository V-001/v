# Finding an internship

## What is an internship? 
An internship is a short-term work experience for students offered by various organizations for people to get basic exposure to a particular industry or field. Internships can vary in duration but typically are offered during the summer semester for students but various programs exist for the semester. Internships can enhance your skill set, broaden your professional network, and provide access to industries that might be challenging to enter while in school.

Co-ops are similar programs but differ in time-commitment as they span multiple semesters or (in very rare cases) years. The advice given in this page also applies for co-ops.
