# PHYS213

PHYS213 (University Physics: Thermal Physics) is a 2-credit hour, second half 8-week long, course that is required for ECE majors as a part of the Foundational Mathematics and Science requirement. It is also required for physics majors. It is offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters.

## Content Covered

- Equilibrium and entropy
- Heat and temperature
- Ideal gases
- Heat capacity
- Thermodynamic/Reversible processes
- Boltzmann factor
- Helmholtz/Gibbs free energy
  
PHYS213 is the introduction to thermodynamics for ECE majors. Being only 8 weeks long, the course does not go too in depth about most topics, but most ECE majors do not need to know more than the cursory knowledge provided.

## Prerequisites

- [PHYS211](PHYS211.md)
- [MATH241](../MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH241.md) (Corequisite)

The official prerequisites for PHYS213 are [PHYS211](PHYS211.md) and credit or concurrent registration in [MATH241](../MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH241.md). There is almost no direct overlap in content between the physics courses, and very little calculus, in general, is used.

## When to Take It

ECE majors typically take PHYS213 and [PHYS214](PHYS214.md) during the same semester after taking [PHYS212](PHYS212.md). The two courses are designed to be taken in the same semester and are in opposite halves, so it ends up filling roughly the same amount of time as a normal 4 credit hour, with the content changing halfway through.

## Course Structure

PHYS213 holds 3 lectures per week, with prelectures and checkpoints to complete before each lecture. Usually, two lectures are spent covering new content and the 3rd lecture is a lecture that goes over examples. The prelectures and checkpoints are where students will do most of the learning, with the lectures being mainly for reexplaination and clarification. 

Homework is assigned after each lecture in smartPhysics (free for PHYS213). The homework for each week's lectures are typically due at the same time early during the following week.

There are 2 midterm exams and 1 final exam, all taken through Prarielearn at the CBTF. 

There are 3 bi-weekly labs. 

There are 7 weekly discussions. These are extremely helpful is getting detailed explanations and clarification from the TAs. 

## Instructors

In the past, this course has been taught by Professors Wagner and Covey.

## Course Tips

The key to this course is the equation sheet. Learn how to use all the equations and the homework/exams should be fairly simple. There are also provided practice exams released before the real thing. They are usually very similar to the actual exam, so they are the best tool to study.

The discussions are extremely helpful in understanding and mastering the concepts. The worksheets will go step by step in solving similar problems on the exam. Completing and fully understanding the discussion worksheets is highly recommended for success in this course. 

## Life After

Students who wish to go more in depth into thermal physics should take the undergraduate course in statistical mechanics, [PHYS427](PHYS427.md) - Thermal and Statistical Physics.

## Infamous Topics

- Entropy: It is a very strange concept, so watching the prelecture a few times is recommended.
